	\section{Evaluation and promotion of the model}
	Question I analyzes the data given in attachment, presents the relationships between the payment characteristics in the form of graphs, enables an objective, visual measure of each factor's role in the data form, and analyzes the city's travel payment characteristics by car, and provides a foundational data support for the latter question.
\par
Question two develops a mathematical model of a third-party mobile payment platform that is reliable and objective and comprehensive in incorporating factors influencing revenue and expenditure, and segments the profitability model into individual modules, with the resolution of re quantitation yielding profitability results that improve functional accuracy and precision.
\par
Question three builds an innovation diffusion model that generalizes data from a quarter of applications to data when they are all applied. And the preconditions for the use of this model are explained using both the aggregate and non - aggregate models that address the supply-demand relationship, with the scientifically complete building of a new model and the profitability model incorporating the second question. To find the relationship between guest flows, coverage of third party payment platform payment, and corporate profitability of third party payment, we bring the data into the model to experiment.
\par
The model used in this question is innovative and efficient, using expertise to complete the modeling process. The multiple models established in this paper are innovative and practically practical, make full use of all data and indicator factors attached, are analysed and evaluated in terms of their nature and quantity, provide good pricing schemes for different items and modes of operation, and have a wide range of applicability.
